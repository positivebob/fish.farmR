# Yo!

Well isn't this lovely! I get to pretend that I'm talking to the entire world. And yet I don't want to speak to the whole world, I want to speak only to you, the person who wants to know more about world of aquaculture data analysis and visualization. I am so glad that you are here! We will have fun learning about this fascinating and growing ecosystem of information and real actions on the ground.  We have a chance to impact the most significant change in the food system since (?). What is this compared to? 

We will try to remain enmeshed in a sense of curiosity and proceed with confidence using R as our sword. We shall embark on a bit of fun! 

Remaining ever in your service,

Robert
