title: About fish.farmR
---

This is an open notebook that is focused on the application of R-based tools to gather and explore data sets that may be relevant to aquaculture operations, finance, and economics. We will look at the global situation as well as the scale of the farm, as we are lead by our interests.  I suppose there will be ample opportunity to stray about between scales of analysis. 

I would say confidently that I identify mostly with what I don't know about this topic and less with what I do. So come along with me as I explore along and through! We may discover something altogether new!
