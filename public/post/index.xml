      <description>purposeExplore aquaculture economic data from the European Commisson, Fisheries and Aquaculture: Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).
analyst noteThis is part 1. As I move through the stages of exploration, and when I feel like it might be worth sharing with you, I’ll post another part. Each part will include data and package load steps, so that they can be more stand-alone.

      <description>Yo!Well isn’t this lovely! I get to pretend that I’m talking to the entire world. And yet I don’t want to speak to the whole world, I want to speak only to you, the person who wants to know more about world of aquaculture data analysis and visualization. I am so glad that you are here! We will have fun learning about this fascinating and growing ecosystem of information and real actions on the ground.</description>
