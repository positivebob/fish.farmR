      <description>This is an &amp;lsquo;open notebook&amp;rsquo; that is focused on the application of R-based tools to gather and explore data sets relevant to aquaculture operations, finance, and economics. I identify with my ignorance and not with my knowledge on the topic. So come along with me as I bumble through!

      <description>Yo!Well isn’t this lovely! I get to pretend that I’m talking to the entire world. And yet I don’t want to speak to the whole world, I want to speak only to you, the person who wants to know more about world of aquaculture data analysis and visualization. I am so glad that you are here! We will have fun learning about this fascinating and growing ecosystem of information and real actions on the ground.</description>
